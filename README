1. Installation

1.1 Matlab module

Compile the mex file with

  make mexfile

which will produce a file emdflow.<mex-extension>, where <mex-extension> is the
mex file name extension of your system.

Currently the only dependency is mex, the Matlab module compiler, which needs to
be installed on your system. Note that mex requires g++ on UNIX systems.

The makefile assumes that mex is available on the command line as mex. If this
is not the case on your system, you can override the path to the mex compiler:

  make MEX='/path/to/mex' mexfile


1.2 Command-line program

The package also contains a command-line program for testing purposes. You can
compile it with

  make emd_flow

Note that the emd_flow binary depends on the boost library (in particular, the
program options library).

3. Usage

3.1 Matlab module

The name of the function is emd_flow. It requires at least three parameters:

- X, a 2D-matrix containing the signal amplitudes.
  Note that the algorithm works with the absolute values of X directly
  without squaring the amplitudes first. So if you want to get an
  l2-guarantee, pass X.^2 into emd_flow.

- s, the per-column sparsity of the resulting projection.

- B, the EMD budget. B can be either a single value or an interval [B_low,
  B_high]. For a single value, emd_flow tries to find the best signal
  using at most an EMD-budget B. For an interval, emd_flow tries to find a
  signal approximation using at least B_low EMD-budget and at most B_high
  EMD-budget. Specifying an interval instead of a single value can speed up
  the convergence of the algorithm considerably.

Moreover, emd_flow accepts an optional fourth parameter opts, which can
specify a number of additional options:

- opts.verbose, a boolean flag that indicates whether emd_flow shoud provide
  verbose output. Default: false.

- opts.lambda_low, the initial guess for the lower bound on the Lagrangian
  relaxation parameter lambda. An incorrect guess will be corrected by the
  algorithm. A good guess for lambda_low can speed up the convergence of the
  algorithm considerably. A good source for a guess for lambda_low is a previous
  run of lambda_low with similar parameters.

- opts.lambda_high, the initial guess for the upper bound on the Lagrangian
  relaxation parameter lambda. As with lambda_low, an incorrect guess will be
  corrected by the algorithm and a good guess can speed up the convergence of
  the algorithm considerably.

- opts.num_iterations, the maximum number of iterations the algorithm performs
  in the binary search over lambda. Note that the initial iterations for finding
  correct values for lambda_low and lambda_high do not count towards this
  number.


After a successful run of emd_flow, the algorithm returns the following values:

[support, emd_cost, amp_sum, final_lambda_low, final_lambda_high]

- support is a 2D-matrix with the same dimensions as the input parameter X.
  Each entry in support is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the corresponding
  entry of X is part of the support or not.

- emd_cost is the total EMD-cost of the support identified by emd_flow.

- amp_sum is the sum of absolute values of the supported entries in X.

- final_lambda_low is the lower bound on lambda in the last iteration of the
  binary search. If you run emd_flow several times on similar inputs, consider
  using this value as an initial guess for lambda_low in order to speed up
  convergence.
  
- final_lambda_high is the lower bound on lambda in the last iteration of the
  binary search. If you run emd_flow several times on similar inputs, consider
  using this value as an initial guess for lambda_high in order to speed up
  convergence.
